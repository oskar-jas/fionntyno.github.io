            <p>this is darth plagueis the wise, the evil sith lord. He was the sith who showed palpitine the dark side of the force.</p><br> 
            <p>Darth Plagueis was a male Dark Lord of the Sith and the master of Darth Sidious. He acquired very impressable knowledge in midi-chlorian manipulation, but was ultimately betrayed and murdered by his own apprentice, in accordance with the "Rule of Two."</p>
            <p>Sidious later recounted the tale of his master's demise to lure Anakin Skywalker to the dark side.</p>
            
            
            <p>"Darth Plagueis was a Dark Lord of the Sith so powerful and so wise, he could use the Force to influence the midi-chlorians to create life. He had such a knowledge of the dark side, he could even keep the ones he cared about from dying."-Palpatine</p>
            <p>"Unfortunately, he taught his apprentice everything he knew. Then his apprentice killed him in his sleep. Ironic. He could save others from death, but not himself."
â€•Palpatine </p>    
            <p>he became so powerful that the only thing he feared was losing his power. Ultimately, Plagueis' only fear was bound to come true.</p>
            
            
            <p>many people believe that Darth Plaguis is Snoke in the The Force Awakens</p>
